In order to run the simulation on a Board with tailored sizing using the primitive approach, compile the Sudoku class and run it with 2 arguments in the Terminal, including:
                        - The first argument specifying the size of the board
                        - The second argument specifying the number of locked values on the board.
For exmaple, one can run a simulation on a 16x16 board with 40 locked values using these commands:
                        - javac Sudoku.java
                        - java Sudoku 16 40

In order to run the simulation on a Board with tailored sizing using the human-inspired approach, compile the Exploration class and run it with 2 arguments in the Terminal, including:
                        - The first argument specifying the size of the board
                        - The second argument specifying the number of locked values on the board.
For exmaple, one can run a simulation on a 16x16 board with 40 locked values using these commands:
                        - javac Exploration.java
                        - java Exploration 16 40
